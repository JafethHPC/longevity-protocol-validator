When starting a new feature, implementation, fix, etc, I want you to create a new Linear ticket using the Linear MCP server. When you and me agree that the new feature, implementation, fix, etc has been completed then i want you to create a commit message with the abbreviation/prefix of the ticket and its number with the commit message.

For example, we are creating a feature to add a new button, you create a ticket on Linear(TIK-1234) and move it into progress. We code until the button is completed. Then we agree that its been completed and you commit with "TIK-1234 Created new button layout" and move the Linear ticket into "Done" status and push the code. DONT PUSH OR COMMIT ANYTHING UNLESS I TELL YOU TO DO SO. IF I DONT TELL YOU TO COMMIT AND PUSH, DONT DO IT. DONT CREATE ISSUES UNLESS YOU MENTION TO ME WHAT THE ISSUE TICKET YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE AND THEN I TELL YOU TO CREATE IT
